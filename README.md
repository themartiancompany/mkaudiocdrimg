This program is a dependency for the
cross-platform port of the
[PlayStation SoundScope Player](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/soundscope-player).

## Installation

The program in this source repo
can be installed from source using GNU Make.

```bash
make \
  install
```

The program has been officially published on the
the uncensorable
[Ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/ur)
user repository and application store as
`mkaudiocdrimg`.
The source code is published on the
[Ethereum Virtual Machine File System](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/evmfs)
so it can't possibly be taken down.

To install it from there just type

```bash
ur \
  mkaudiocdrimg
```

A censorable HTTP Github mirror of the recipe published there,
containing a full list of the software dependencies needed to run the
tools is hosted on
[mkaudiocdrimg-ur](
  https://github.com/themartiancompany/mkaudiocdrimg-ur).

Be aware the mirror could go offline any time
as Github and more in general all HTTP resources
are inherently unstable and censorable.

### Documentation

Manual entry for `mkaudiocdrimg` can be consulted
using the `man` utility and it is
automatically installed with the program.

```bash
man \
  mkaudiocdrimg
```
